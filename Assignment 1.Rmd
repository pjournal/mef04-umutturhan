## Mapping NBA Shot Locations

  This post is inspired by an article written by a cartographer analyzing NBA players' shots and mapping out some interesting visuals. The original article took data from NBA database and conducted various analysis while visualizing the data on basketball field. The first visual mapped NBA shots by location, showing most shooters tend to have a higher shooting activity around 3-point arc and near the basket. The second visual focused on the success rate by location. In general, it can be inferred that as the shooter gets closer to the basket, the success rate increases on the other hand, the article also drew attention to the fact that shots from different areas in the basketball field have somewhat similar success rate even though some worth 2 points whereas the others worth 3 points. Therefore, the next visual also took points into consideration, showing the map of points per shot, which indicated that if a player is not around the basket then it's better to take the shoot behind 3-point arc since it has similar success rate with those worth 2 points. The final figure combines "points per shot" and "most common locations for shot" into a single map. The article concluded that not surprisingly, the lower success rate areas resulted in as a decrease in the preference of a player for 2 point jump shooting.

"Mapping NBA Shot Locations" takes data from the same database and makes the analysis and visuals with R package called "rayshader".
